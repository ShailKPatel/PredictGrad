["PredictGrad\u2019s risk detection is spot-on for my class. I\u2019d appreciate a feature to track interventions and their impact over time.", "The tool\u2019s ability to predict my Semester 3 marks is impressive, but the interface feels clunky on mobile. More actionable feedback would help.", "The regression models are solid, but the app needs better visualization for individual student trends.", "PredictGrad helps identify at-risk students early. The risk prediction is accurate, but the UI could be more intuitive for quick data uploads."]
